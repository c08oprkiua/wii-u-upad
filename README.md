# wii-u-upad
Small library to merge VPAD and KPAD for one-input-source GUI apps

This is a small little library designed to make it so that simple GUI apps that don't need to differentiate input sources can take inputs from any Wiimote, Gamepad, or HID device connected to the Wii U, without much extra effort on the app developer.

API is pretty similar to VPAD and KPAD
